				<h2>A bit about James</h2>
				<p>James has a degree in Biological Sciences from Edinburgh University and an HNC in Computer Networking. He has had a successful 7 year career working in operations, latterly as a lead SaaS Sysadmin. With a pragmatic and efficient approach to work he has concentrated on automation and stability of service. Having always had an interest in science and technology and seen the value in education, cooperation and the open sharing of knowledge it seemed like a logical step to move to development as a way to be able to create useful tools and make a difference.</p>
